    <p> <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification"> Donald John Trump</a></strong> (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician,
        media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States
        from 2017 to 2021.</p>
    <p>Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in 
        economics in 1968. He became president of his father's real-estate business in 1971 
        and renamed it the Trump Organization. He expanded its operations to building and 
        renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses and later started side ventures, 
        mostly by licensing his name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television 
        series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 state 
        and federal legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.</p>
    <p>Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican nominee against Democratic nominee 
        Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. During the campaign, his political positions 
        were described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. His election and 
        policies sparked numerous protests. He was the first U.S. president with no prior military or 
        government service. The 2017~2019 special counsel investigation established that Russia 
        interfered in the 2016 election to favor his campaign. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and 
        made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree 
        unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as 
        racially charged or racist and many as misogynistic.</p>
    <p>As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, 
        diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and implemented a 
        policy of family separations for apprehended migrants. He weakened environmental protections, 
        rolling back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the Tax Cuts and 
        Jobs Act of 2017, which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the individual 
        health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett 
        Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. He initiated a trade war with China 
        and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris 
        Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong 
        Un three times but made no progress on denuclearization. 
        He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, 
        used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation 
        about unproven treatments.</p>
