    <h2>Donald Trump's Business career</h2>
    <p> Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's 
        first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, 
        adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[53] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city 
        property tax abatement arranged by Fred Trump,[50] who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed
        a $70 million in bank construction financing.[54] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand 
        Hyatt Hotel,[55] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, 
        a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[56] The building houses the headquarters 
        of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.
